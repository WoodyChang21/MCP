## üéØ Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will understand:
- How to integrate third-party MCP servers with LangChain
- Configuration and deployment strategies
- Frontend development with MCP backends and LangChain agents
- Production deployment considerations
- API key management and security
- **LangChain Integration**: Using third-party MCP servers with LangChain agents

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Complete the MCP fundamentals and server building sections
2. **Choose your integration**:
   - **Tako MCP**: For data visualization and analysis
   - **Streamlit Frontend**: For building user interfaces
3. **Follow the README files** in each subdirectory for setup instructions

## üéØ Quick Demo: Streamlit Chat Interface

To see the complete system in action, follow this 3-step process:

### Step 1: Launch Tako MCP Server
```bash
cd tako-mcp
cp env.template .env
# Edit .env and add your TAKO_API_KEY
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 2: Launch Streamlit Frontend
```bash
cd ../streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Set up .env with OPENAI_API_KEY and deployment_name
streamlit run frontend.py
```

### Step 3: Backend Logic
The `tako_graph.py` file handles the MCP server connections and LangChain agent integration.

**Result**: You'll have a fully functional chat interface using MCP servers with LangChain agents!

## üîß What You'll Learn
