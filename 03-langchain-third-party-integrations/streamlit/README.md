# MCP Agent with Streamlit Frontend

This setup provides a Streamlit frontend that directly uses your MCP agent backend logic, showing intermediate results and step-by-step processes.

## ðŸš€ Complete Setup Walkthrough

Follow these three steps to launch the chat interface:

### Step 1: Launch the Tako MCP Server
```bash
# Navigate to the tako-mcp directory
cd ../tako-mcp

# Set up your Tako API key
cp env.template .env
# Edit .env and add your TAKO_API_KEY

# Launch the server with Docker Compose (run this from tako-mcp directory)
docker compose up -d
```

**Verify the server is running:**
```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
```
The server will be available at `http://localhost:8002/mcp`

### Step 2: Launch the Streamlit Frontend
