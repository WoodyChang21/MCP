# MCP Learning Journey

A comprehensive guide to learning and implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) from fundamentals to production-ready applications.

## üéØ Learning Path

This repository is organized in a logical progression that takes you from MCP basics to advanced implementations:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [01 - MCP Fundamentals](./01-mcp-fundamentals/)
**Start here if you're new to MCP**
- Complete MCP crash course with hands-on examples
- Understanding MCP concepts and architecture
- Basic server and client implementations
- **Source**: [Dave Ebbelaar's AI Cookbook](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [02 - LangChain MCP Servers](./02-langchain-mcp-servers/)
**Learn to build MCP servers with LangChain agents**
- Custom server implementations from scratch
- HTTP, SSE, and STDIO transport methods
- Tool definition and implementation patterns
- NPX server integration and debugging
- **LangChain Integration**: Using LangChain agents as MCP clients

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [03 - LangChain Third-Party Integrations](./03-langchain-third-party-integrations/)
**Integrate production-ready MCP solutions with LangChain**
- Tako MCP server for data visualization
- Streamlit frontend development
- Production deployment strategies
- Real-world application patterns
- **LangChain Integration**: Third-party MCP servers with LangChain agents

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Begin with fundamentals**: Navigate to `01-mcp-fundamentals/`
2. **Follow the numbered sequence**: Each section builds upon the previous
3. **Hands-on learning**: Execute code examples and build projects
4. **LangChain Integration**: Learn to use MCP servers with LangChain agents
5. **Production ready**: End with deployable MCP applications using LangChain
